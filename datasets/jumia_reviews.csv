Unbelievable. Ordered 4 HP printer cartridges . They are fake. No ink at all. Very bad experience.,5/1/2023
"Made payments through their paybill, they claim I need to have the payment made through their online platform. Called numerous times for my refund coz my order is still pending and yet no positive feedback. Everytime it's a different story of I will confirm. Too tiring and discouraging for someone who has all their household items from Jumia. Pathetic service on refunds.",4/1/2023
"Bought Olay regenerist 3point 9,000kshThey delivered wrong product Olay moisturizer which cost around 4,500ksh after return for exchange they refused to return money and infact the delivery guy who delivered returned with the product after realizing it's wrong item .now I lost 9,000 they never respond and never refund...jumia claim of refund is lie ..you loose your money",3/1/2023

Can someone do something??? Have communicating wth customer care all they keep saying is someone will communicate to you, yet no one has ....its disappointing,  I always do my orders from jumia but this time you have lost a customer coz that was my last orderI need this issue to be solved ASAP",2/1/2023
"**Without Prejudice**Where do I begin:-1. Some products are 'sub-standard'2. Customer care is extremely poor3. As a vendor, their payment system sucks (got my payment after 8months)!! Gave up selling with them!4. Refunds follow-ups are a 'nightmare'. Awaiting my refund 3weeks now!5. Absolutely NO 'after-sales' customer service (connected to voicemails interactive only)!6. Charge but don't give ETR's or electronic receipts (until pestered)! I wonder if KRA knows about this ??Im done using Jumia...Im sure there are other options out there...soon!",6/1/2021
"The worse experience. Delivery doesn't happens. You paid for a door to door delivery but the person in charge of delivery ask you to go to pick your parcel. If you don't go, they cancel your order. Very frustration after waiting 3 weeks the items. Customer support talk like robot and cannot deliver the parcel after cancellation. Beginning was nice, now JUMIA is a bid disaster. Runaway from them",9/1/2022
"Worst shopping experience. I tried to buy micellar water , proceeding to check out, I COULD NOT PAY FOR MY ORDER because their mpesa payment generator doesn't work. Neither could credit card work also. I call their Rude customer care who says they will initiate payment from their side , she says I hold on someone will get back to me and guide me. They have never called me to date.",7/1/2021
"I recently bought a solar kit on Jumia platform. It was delivered minus one item. Upon enquiry, customer care staff were quick to offer a voucher of ksh. 300 as compensation for an item worth 1200. The missing item was used to lure customers make purchase and never intended to be delivered. I have an incomplete kit and will have to spend more money or return the kit for  refund. Having experienced their refund  process that will take forever. Jumia must style up and stop colluding with their partners to steal from the public. Dose anyone know which government agency you can report to?",6/1/2022
"They are horrible to sellers, don't leave your items at their warehouse as they will take every thing when the item does not sell and blame you for not collecting the items despite contacting them numerous times. They are thieves and liars",2/1/2022
Please do not buy a new iPhone from Jumia. I ordered for a new iPhone x phone from them and they sold me a refurbished phone despite the fact that I paid for a new phone. When I asked them about it they said that my item is under warranty and there is nothing they can do about it. If you have encountered a similar situtation kindly leave a message here we are looking for more victims so that we can bring a claim against them under consumer protection.,6/1/2022
"They are horrible to their sellers, make a mistake and go under 3 on the seller score and you will remain there so that they can keep charging you every week.They delay order delivery, their riders are rude, customer service is horrible. Then they little you get they milk out at an exorbitant rate. Google should introduce 0 stars.",1/1/2022
"That this shop is even running is a wonder…no, as in none whatsoever, contact with customer care as they call it - wow, just wow.Items missing, showing up a month late. I’m sure someone will be able to do this much better in Kenya, and I’m looking forward to that day !",7/1/2022
"The online payment system is a mess especially if you are outside the country. I think they are just satisfied with the local market. If they cannot tap into payment options such as foreign bank cards, PayPal, e.t.c., they have no business being in online business. Tried to buy items for my relatives but simply could not. Unless this is fixed, I honestly think that was my last attempt and predict that they won’t survive long.Ayub",12/1/2020
"I wish I could subtract to zero star for this fake business, apparently at the very door of my shopping experience. I tried to have them deliver a substantial order for apparels totalling ksh70,000 for my family. I added everything to cart until I reached shipping costs. A whopping ksh9000? Yet items were to be picked in the city at afya center. These people are jokers, no way to reach their pre-purchase customer care only a dead give away to their inefficiency, mediocrity, disarrayed and unscrupulous company. In the meanwhile, I will shop at mall and put my items in a cart drive home. Rather than take the place of Amazon in kenya to give us the beauty of online shopping, they're not anywhere near Mama mboga in terms of customer service. Stay away",10/1/2020
"Jumia is a good online shopping site to shop almost anything from. It saves you time, energy and I can say sometimes money. Though one has to be wary when shopping for generic stuff like electronics. And I don't know why they keep selling generic stuff, they are so many generic and overpriced stuff. All in all, anyone can go for it",9/1/2021
"I paid for delivery of a gift to a friend. But although she was home they sent me an email that delivery was unsuccessful and that if the next delivery was also unsuccessful the order would be cancelled. They never went to deliver for sure.On their next attempt my friend was on the phone with the delivery guy every hour during the day and he kept saying that she should pay to have her gift delivered, which she ultimately agreed to even though I already paid for delivery.In other words Jumia's drivers extort their customers to double-pay for delivery.Find another vendor if you can.",4/1/2022
"I bought a sub-wooofer from them as loyal customer ,  found it had a problem. I returned to their pickup station ,  their representative said it has problem. However, when they checked at their headquarters,  they said the claim is invalid.To add matters , when I called their customer care , if I was in Nairobi,  I  would have  verified my claim if I wanted take further action. I am frustrated.If you buy things here, just know the return and refund process has a lot of frustration. Very useless.",7/1/2021
"As a loyal customer, I would say Jumia is Great. If you want to buy legit products, look for the 'official store' icon. Especially for laptops and electronics. You won't regret it. My experience has been great over the past years. Kudos!",9/1/2022
Pathetic services . selling 3ply surgical mask at 6k and delivery 2ply very low quality that what you advertise . customer service only there to take orders but not handle complaints.  6k is not a lot but you will loose big time,4/1/2020
"Unfair cancellationPrepaid Orders cancelled an hour after arriving at the pick-up point.Customer service personnel (Grace) cites a technical issue,.was that my fault Grace? we are looking for other options",12/1/2022
